# The __init__.py file for the 'vendors' subpackage within the Multi-Vendor API wrapper.

# This file fulfills two major roles:
# 1. It signifies to the Python interpreter that the directory in which it's located
#    should be treated as a Python package. This convention is necessary for Python
#    to understand and manage the package structure, ensuring that the package
#    components are appropriately recognized and usable within your project.

# 2. It exposes specific classes or functions at the package level. In this case,
#    the file imports everything (*) from the 'get_vendors' module. This allows for
#    easier and more intuitive importing of these components in other parts of your
#    application. For example, after this import, one can directly use
#    'from vendors import VendorsService' in their code, avoiding more complex
#    and verbose import statements.

# The main benefit of this approach is the convenient access it provides to the
# VendorsService class, which encapsulates all the functionalities for interacting
# with the Vendors API in a Multi-Vendor environment. The class offers methods to
# handle vendor-related operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and
# deleting vendor information, thereby abstracting the complexity of direct API
# interactions.
